    <h3>
        In the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable
        large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The
        machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and
        Prussia. Early "juke-box" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in Long
        Beach, Washington (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The Musical Museum, Brentford,
        London has a number of machines.[2] The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection,
        including interactive exhibits. In addition to video and audio footage of each piece, the actual instruments are
        demonstrated for the public daily on a rotational basis.
